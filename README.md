# List if contents

This package contains
(1) The test file index.html (Mockup of https://daydot.agency/)

(2) The script (Exact copy contained inside the script tags in index.html)

This is a development version of a final version. It's not ready for production.

### Functionality:
(1) When clicking "CONTROL" button, the control version of the website should remain unchanged

(2) When clicking "VARIATION" button, the homepage should have the following changes (that can be reversed back to control when clicking the "CONTROL" button)

Both buttons should have a "active" state class (different color) when active.

VARIATION CHANGES:

Change the copy of the masthead to: "Our mission is simple: to unleash our clientsâ€™ recurring revenue growth."

Add a CTA underneath the masthead copy that links to " https://daydot.agency/who-we-are"
Have the whole color scheme of the page changed, background, fonts, etc (freedom of creativity here, use whatever colors you feel appropriate, not necessarily on brand)
Have the Latest case studies open in a popup (similar to Lightbox)

### Notes:

This script is not supported in IE <= 9 or Safari <=5.0 but has been tested in Chrome (Latest version)
